## Expense vs Income Tracker

Short and practical: a tiny Java app to track expenses and incomes — add entries and see totals.

---

Quick use:

- CLI: `bash cli.sh` — run it in the terminal.
- GUI: `bash ui.sh` — opens a small Swing interface.
- Tests: Basic JUnit tests live in `test/` to check model behavior.

notes:

- This is a learning-focused assignment: small, readable Java classes, a simple Swing UI, and unit tests.
- Language models were used to speed up development; I understand and can explain every line of code.
